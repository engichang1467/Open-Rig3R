# 🛰️ Rig3R: Rig-Aware Conditioning for Learned 3D Reconstruction

**Rig3R** is a transformer-based model for multiview 3D reconstruction and camera pose estimation that incorporates **rig-aware conditioning**.
Unlike prior models (e.g., DUSt3R, Fast3R), Rig3R learns to leverage **rig metadata** (camera ID, timestamp, and rig pose) when available, and can **infer rig structure** when not — enabling robust 3D reconstruction across unstructured and rig-based image sets.

This repository is a **reimplementation** of the original [Rig3R paper (Li et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02265), built for clarity, reproducibility, and extensibility.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Rig-aware transformer architecture** using ViT-Large encoder-decoder.
* **Joint prediction** of:
  * Pointmaps (dense 3D coordinates),
  * Pose raymaps (global frame),
  * Rig raymaps (rig-relative frame).
* **Rig discovery**: infers rig calibration from unordered image collections. (In progress)
* **Closed-form camera pose recovery** from raymaps. 
* **Multi-task learning** with dropout-based metadata conditioning.
